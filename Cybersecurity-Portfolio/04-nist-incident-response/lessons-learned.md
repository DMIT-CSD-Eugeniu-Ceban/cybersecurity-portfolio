# Lessons Learned

This section summarizes the key takeaways from the incident response process
and identifies areas for improvement to reduce the likelihood and impact of
similar incidents in the future.

## What Worked Well
- Existing logging and monitoring controls allowed the security team to detect
  unusual activity in a timely manner.
- Clear incident response procedures helped guide containment and recovery
  actions.
- Communication between technical and security teams supported efficient
  decision-making during the response phase.

## Gaps Identified
- Some systems lacked sufficient monitoring, which could delay detection in
  similar incidents.
- Access controls were not consistently reviewed, increasing the risk of
  unauthorized activity.
- Incident response documentation could be improved to provide clearer
  escalation paths.

## Recommended Improvements
- Enhance centralized logging and alerting to improve visibility across all
  systems.
- Perform regular access reviews and apply the principle of least privilege.
- Update and test incident response playbooks on a scheduled basis.
- Provide ongoing security awareness training to reduce human-related risks.

## Alignment With NIST Cybersecurity Framework
- **Identify:** Improve asset inventory and risk assessment accuracy.
- **Protect:** Strengthen access controls and security policies.
- **Detect:** Expand monitoring and alerting capabilities.
- **Respond:** Refine response procedures and communication workflows.
- **Recover:** Document recovery steps and implement preventive controls.

## Conclusion
By addressing the identified gaps and implementing these improvements, the
organization can reduce its attack surface, improve detection capabilities,
and strengthen its overall security posture.
