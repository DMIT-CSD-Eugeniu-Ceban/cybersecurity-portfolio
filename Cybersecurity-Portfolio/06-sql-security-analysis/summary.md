# SQL Security Analysis — Summary

## Summary
This project demonstrates how SQL can be used to support cybersecurity investigations by filtering and correlating structured data.

Using login attempt records and employee information, I identified failed authentications, after-hours access, suspicious locations, and affected departments. JOIN operations were used to connect login activity to specific users and machines.

These techniques are commonly used in SOC and incident response environments to triage alerts and assess impact.
