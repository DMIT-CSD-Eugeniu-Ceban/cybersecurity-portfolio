# SQL Security Analysis

## Overview
This project demonstrates how SQL is used in cybersecurity investigations to analyze login activity, identify suspicious behavior, and determine which employees and systems are affected.

The queries focus on:
- Failed authentication attempts
- After-hours access
- Location-based filtering
- Department and machine impact
- Correlating data across multiple tables

---

## Scenario
You are a security analyst investigating suspicious login activity within an organization. Using structured data from employee records, machines, and login attempts, you must filter and correlate information to support incident response.

---

## Skills demonstrated
- Filtering with WHERE, AND, OR, NOT
- Pattern matching with LIKE
- Date and time analysis
- JOINs across multiple tables
- Security-driven data investigation
